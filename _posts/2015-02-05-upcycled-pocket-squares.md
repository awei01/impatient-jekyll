We're always trying to think of ways to reduce waste and do more for our environment. So, we've collected your old shirt trimmings and our unworn sample shirts and turned them into pocket squares! These 100% cotton pocket squares are not only insanely soft, but they are also a perfect accessory to adorn any jacket or blazer. Our upcycled, limited edition pocket squares are $35.00.

Also, stop by our sample sale this week (2/6 through 2/14). For more information, click [here.](http://blog.9tailors.com/2015/02/one-week-only-sample-sale/) Or, contact us at 617.286.6135 or at [info@9tailors.com](mailto:info@9tailors.com).
