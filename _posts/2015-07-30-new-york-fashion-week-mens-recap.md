Just a few short weeks ago, men’s fashion took over New York City for the first annual New York Fashion Week: Men’s (NYFW:M). Organized by the Council of Fashion Designers of America, NYFW:M allowed members of the menswear industry the opportunity to focus solely on menswear without the time constraints and scheduling conflicts of womenswear collections.

The event featured new Spring 2016 collections, as well as restagings of collections that American brands had previously shown in other countries. In total there were about 60 shows by either emerging or established designers. And although we couldn’t be at the shows, we combed through photos of the four-day affair to summarize what you missed.

_Timo Weiland_\- Slimmer fits reigned at this presentation, with juxtaposing textures adding playfulness to the simple silhouettes. By mixing slightly varying shades of navy, adding a leather pocket, or making a jacket in soft suede, Weiland provided just enough visual interest.

_John Varvatos_\- Menswear veteran John Varvatos brought ’70s rock and roll to the runway. Think long grungy hair, vertically striped three-piece suits, and flaming red velvet coats.

_Public School_\- A mix of sporty and dapper, Public School brought the minimalist cool that has become their signature in the short time they have been on the scene. Their presentation was also one of the most unique with the models, and a few non-model style icons like Nick Wooster and Waris Ahluwalia, standing in a police lineup.

_Todd Snyder_\- Snyder’s time spent on the Amalfi Coast of Italy inspired this collection, which included lots of casual but not careless sweater and pant combos. All of his looks were crisply coordinated, with one of the most notable ensembles being an all-white suit, complete with white shoes, that served as the show’s finale.

_Billy Reid_\- An earthy color palette and baggy cuts defined Billy Reid’s collection. Reid also showed several jacquard knits that were intended to resemble mosaics of nature, complete with hints of leaves, everglades, and fossil shells.

_Anzevino Getty_\- This collection took the standard dress for all occasions and added plenty of bold twists for the adventurous man. It seemed as if the designers were urging you to not just go to work in a black suit and white shirt, but instead a black and white ikat version. Or they wanted you to not just settle for a solid sweatshirt, but a half-sleeved, yellow one and with zipped pockets. This show was a high-fashion take on classics.

_Rag & Bone_\- The high-flying sport parkour inspired Rag & Bone’s David Neville and Marcus Wainwright to use durable and easy-to-move-in fabrics. Their long coats and bomber jackets would easily transition from sport to everyday.

_N. Hoolywood_\- While approximately the first third of the show was all neutrals, several large and intricate prints later in the show revealed N. Hoolywood’s inspiration to be calligraphy and typography. Daisuke Obana, the designer behind N. Hoolywood, presented the prints in varying amounts so if a full, brushstroke painted suit isn’t your thing you could opt for it on some shorts or a comfortable tee-shirt.

So out of all of these shows, what are the trends that are sure to earn you sartorial success in the upcoming months? Well blue, a menswear staple, was shown in full force, proving that the color in any fabric, from suede to wool, or any shade, from navy to teal, is still a winner for both suits and casualwear. And while at first glance, the graphics in these designer collections might seem too large, prints such as soft watercolors and simple pinstripes can be as bold or as subtle as you want for them to be. And lastly, a simple way to look sharp is a monochrome outfit.
