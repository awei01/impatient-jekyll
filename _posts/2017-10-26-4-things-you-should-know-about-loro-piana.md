Loro Piana is an Italian company that specializes in high-end and luxury cashmere and wool fabrics. We recently received Loro Piana fabrics here at 9tailors and after looking at the amazing patterns and feeling how soft they were we compiled a list of things everyone should know about the brand.

1.  Loro Piana purchases Record Bale fabrics, the finest and highest quality wool in the world, in Australia and New Zealand and has been doing so since 1997. Since each bale can only produce a few dozen suits the colors and designs are very exclusive.
2.   Their four season wool is designed to be worn year round. It works exceptionally well for those who want to be stylish without having to give up durability and comfort.
3.  Loro Piana awards an annual prize to the breeder who produces the finest bale in both Australia and New Zealand. This is done to encourage the production of increasingly high quality wool.
4.  Loro Piana is committed to promoting the use of natural fibers. Their Zelander Flower line of fabrics uses walnuts, bilberries and indigo to dye the fabric.
