Christmas has ended but the holiday season strides on. Put the ugly sweaters and stockings away, now is the time for New Years Eve festivities. Themed parties from the [80s](http://bostoneventguide.com/countdown-to-the-80s) to [James Bond](http://www.bostonnewyearseveparty.com/)Â are occurring all over Boston and appropriate attire for each place is a must.

No matter what you wear, wear it with pride. New Years Eve is all about stepping into the new year with a new outlook and a new you. You want to make sure you are dressed for the occasion and make an impression of who you're going to be in 2014. Have (lots) of fun and make a statement with your suits. Too many of our clients come in saying they want to do something fun but are hesitant to. Those of you who took the leap of faith and followed our style consultant's guide to exciting suits with good taste and style, wear those out for your events. We'd love to see pictures! Especially of the velvet jackets and evening suits with a touch of shine and glitter when the light hits them just right ;)

You won't be able to get a suit in time for next week's festivities but don't forget - the holiday season doesn't stop in January and Valentines Day and wedding season is creeping up. Be the groom that stays on top of his to-do list and impress your fiance!

Gilt City vouchers expires January 1, 2014 - don't let it go to waste!
