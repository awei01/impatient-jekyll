Just some quick reminders of what's going on at 9tailors this month. Thursday and Friday we will be in **NYC**, only a few slots left for the fashion conscious-- get yours before they're gone.

Second, the month is coming to an end. And, when that ends so will the **_buy three get one free_** deal! Stock up for the summer on the cheap. We have all the plaid, gingham, stripes, and solids to suit you. Email info@9tailors.com to set up an appointment with a style consultant today!
