Last week was an exciting week for 9tailors! We participated in our first ever fashion show. The fashion show was hosted by Harvard Business School's Retail & Apparel and Social Enterprise Clubs. It was a mix of up-and-coming designers, like [Lily and Migs](http://www.lilyandmigs.com/Lily_%26_Migs_Clothing), and more established brands.

Best of all? All proceeds from the evening went to [Conservation International](http://www.conservation.org/Pages/default.aspx), a non-profit organization on a mission to protecting the environment.

Photos below were taken by the very talented, Bill Downey.

Oh, just in case you are wondering, the models in the photos above are HBS students!
