The madness has calmed down at [9tailors](http://www.blogger.com/www.9tailors.com), for the moment, since we finished the fall photo shoot last Thursday. Here is a sneak peak at what we used for our fun take on fall fashion.

The accessories below were kindly lent to us by our friends over at [Salmagundi](http://www.salmagundiboston.com/). They have some unique hats and accessories for men and women. We also got a couple of [tie clips](http://9tailors.blogspot.com/2011/07/tsai-clip-tie-clips-just-got-hairy.html) from [Tsaiclip](http://www.tsaiclip.com/).

The best part of the shoot was seeing our clients, who were kind enough to become models for a day, dressed to the nines in clothing specifically designed to their taste.

Check out Matt striking a pose for our lovely photographer [Channing Johnson](http://www.channingjohnson.com/) who braved the wind and the rain to capture falls new look.
