[![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/happy_festivus.png)](http://getprept.com/festivus/)  
[Get Prept](http://getprept.com/), a Boston-based interview prep company and [9tailors](http://www.blogger.com/beta.9tailors.com) partner, is giving us another reason to celebrate this holiday season. On Friday, December 18, Get Prept is inviting _YOU_ to Felt Boston for [Festivus for the Rest of Us](http://getprept.com/festivus/).

It's a holiday party that is open to all Boston's young professionals and entrepreneurs! So, if your company is not celebrating this year, don't fret. Bring your friends, co-workers and boss to Get Prept's Festivus.

The best part? No cover. No lines. That's right.

RSVP [here](http://getprept.com/festivus/).
