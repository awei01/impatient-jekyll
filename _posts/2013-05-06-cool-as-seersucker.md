Spring and Summer temperatures are slowly rising, we are already in May! It's that wonderful time of year where the weather is pleasant and you have more events outside than you can count. It's also the time of year when some lighter clothing is necessary. We have cotton and linen fabrics ready to rock for summer suit design extraordinaire. And now...

Seersucker: you wanted it, we got it. A lightweight treasure, seersucker is a coveted fabric this time of year, and we have had quite a battle sourcing it in our fabric market! Perseverance and dedication has paid off and [9tailors](http://www.9tailors.com/) is happy to announce that we will now be offering seersucker. We must warn you, however, we only have a limited amount and will surely run out quickly. See the photos below of some of the swatches we have in stock.
