We received so many wonderful submissions this year for our annual Valentine's Day Giveaway! It was incredibly tough to judge! We were moved by all of the sweet stories, poems, and haikus. So, thank you to all of you who spent the time to submit an entry!

After some serious consideration in the 9tailors studio, we decided to award the free suit to our client, Doug Woodhouse. His rap skills and dance moves totally blew us away.

Well done, Doug! Very well done.
