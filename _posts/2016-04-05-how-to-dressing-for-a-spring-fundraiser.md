Choosing the right outfit for a charity event can be a bit daunting. This is especially true when the invite does not tell you what dress code you should follow. Many charity events are held at upscale venues, museums or hotels. These places generally will call for a more evening look. With that being said you should keep a few distinct dress codes in mind. Remember, it is always better to be overdressed then it is to be under dressed. Fortunately for you we have decoded a few of the most common dress codes to make everything a bit easier.

#### Black Tie

A black tuxedo jacket is always a great go to option. For spring and summer events you can wear a white dinner jacket instead of the traditional black. Traditional tuxedos do have a waist covering. Whether it be a cummerbund or a vest the choice is yours. To finish your look patent leather shoes and black socks work best for this occasion.

Need a full refresher on [black tie basics](http://blog.9tailors.com/2015/10/back-to-the-black-tie-basics/)? We've got you covered!

#### Creative Black Tie

Some events are simply for fun, fundraising and bringing awareness to an amazing cause. If you are lucky enough to receive an invite to a creative black tie event you have the freedom to do more with your ensemble. This has to be a personal favorite of ours.

If you don't want to stray too much from the black tie look you can wear a royal blue tuxedo jacket. You may recall seeing this on the likes of Ryan Gosling. Don't think you can pull it off? Trust us when we say you'll look even more dapper than Mr.Gosling. Royal blue is a nice modern twist on the traditional black tux jacket. Plus a brighter blue is a great color for spring and summer.

Want to take it a step further? Now is the time to add a whimsical touch to your look. Create a monochromatic look, mix and match your shirt and tie patterns or wear a printed blazer with a solid white shirt and a contrasting tie. The choice is yours. Now is the time to have fun.

#### Semi-Formal

Many luncheons can be semi formal depending on the venue. For semi-formal events you can wear a navy or a grey suit. Lighter grey works well for the spring and summer months. Add a bit of pattern with your shirt, tie or both. This isn't as extravagant as creative black tie so keep it a little more work appropriate. This is an awesome opportunity to have a little fun with your socks. Pick a fun color or pattern to show your personality.

#### Smart Casual 

Now smart casual is not as formal as the three previous dress codes, but it is important to keep in mind. Also known as business causal these events range from brunches to less formal dinner events. You also see a smart casual dress code at events where there are many speakers. We suggest wearing a blazer with dress pants and a dress shirt.

Navy is the traditional go to, however do not be afraid to spice it up a bit. Wear that special glen plaid blazer you've been dying to show off. Keep it simple in the shoe department with a pair of loafers in a complimentary color.
