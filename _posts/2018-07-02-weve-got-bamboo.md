Looking smart and staying cool can be a tall order especially as temps soar way into the 90s. But, we've partnered with [Gladson](http://gladsonltd.com/), one of the finest fabric purveyors in the industry, to bring you bamboo suiting fabrics.

**Why bamboo?**

**Sweat absorbent, hypoallergenic and antibacterial - **We love this fabric because it's moisture wicking and keeps you dry.  The light-weight fabric keeps you a few degrees cooler in the heat. At the same time, the material keeps you odor free. It's the perfect fabric for those outdoor barn weddings or summer cocktail sessions at the ICA.

**Vegan and eco-friendly - **For those who care the environment, the bamboo does not require a lot of water to grow and thrives without the use of pesticides or fertilizers. The fabric is also 100% biodegradable. It is one of the most eco-friendly fabrics on the planet.

**Luxurious hand-feel -** Bamboo feels wonderful. The smooth finish and luster give it a subtle elegance. Our tailors are wowed by it's great tailor-ability. Our style consultants say it has a silky look and has sufficient body to drape beautifully over the body. And, our clients are impressed by how handsome they look in the fabric.
