Our model search is finally over. We received dozens of inquiries and saw numerous models at our go-sees. It was a tough decision. Who knew that there were so many good looking, photogenic people in Boston!? But, I'm happy to announce that we've finally decided on our models for our spring/summer campaign!

I'm particularly excited about one of the models, Tee Major, whom we will be shooting this week. Tee was named the winner of [Stuff Boston's "Bodies By Boston 2010](http://stuffboston.com/photos/features/category21040/picture637299.aspx)." It's easy to see why...see image below.

Don't let his good looks fool you; he has a brain too. He runs [Tee Major Fitness](http://www.teemajorfitness.com/), a personal fitness and training business.  
  
We'll be posting some of the behind the scenes pictures from our shoot. Stay tuned!
