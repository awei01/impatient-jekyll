The changing seasons are always a great time to reevaluate your wardrobe. You may purge a few things you have not worn in a few years followed by the addition of a few new items. No matter what the case may be you will want to snag a plaid blazer for the winter. We here at 9tailors love the options that men have to tailor your wardrobe to the seasons. This time of year is the perfect time to introduce new textures and patterns into your wardrobe. Think tweed, glen plaids and bolder colors to offset the colors of the season.

One of our go-to items for this time of year is a wool plaid blazer. A plaid blazer is sporty, yet also dressy enough for the office. By the time Friday comes around you won't want to fuss with your suit and tie when it is time to grab drinks after work. That's where your plaid blazer comes in to save the day.

A subtle windowpane, like the one pictured above, works best if you are new to the world of pattern. It's great for those who do not want to make too much of a statement or want to mix and match patterns easily.

Looking for more of a challenge? A bold windowpane, like the one pictured below, works great as a blazer. A styling tip from us to you: when your blazer has a bolder pattern allow it to take center stage. Do not let the other pieces in your outfit compete with it. A chambray shirt will pick up the subtle blue accents in your blazer. Such as the lapel buttonhole and mini-houndstooth. Also, do not be afraid to mix your patterns. The best thing to do in this scenario is to keep everything in the same color family. The blue, orange, and white in the pocket square are the same colors represented in the rest of the outfit.
