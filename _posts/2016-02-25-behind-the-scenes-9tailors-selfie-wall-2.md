What’s new at 9tailors?

Our loft interior recently got a boost! By just adding some wallpaper and props, we transformed an empty corner, into our now one-of-a-kind selfie wall! You can now drop in and snap a quick pic whenever you’re due for an appointment or fitting.

Show off your snazzy new suit, or take a group selfie with the friends and family you bring along.

Complete with our beloved menswear mannequin Henrique, our decorated nook is the perfect photo op!
