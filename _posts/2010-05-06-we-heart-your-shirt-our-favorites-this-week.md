Just wanted to share some favorite creations that have come through the studio.

[![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/purple_shirts.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_RlJ3L7W6dBw/S-MfnGk4-HI/AAAAAAAAIVU/J2UswfLeMYc/s1600/purple_shirts.jpg)Striped Poplin Shirt and Gingham Shirt  
Both $100.00

I love purple and always recommend it in the studio for several reasons. First, it complements many colors; wears well with gray, navy and black bottoms. Second, it's not blue, but still hints at the color. Third, it's not pink, which many men try to steer clear from. It's a totally wearable color.
