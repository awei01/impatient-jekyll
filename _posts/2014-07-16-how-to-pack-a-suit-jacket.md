It's finally summer! It's time to gear up and unleash your inner adventurer. One of the worst things about travelling? Packing. If you're like many men out there, packing takes about 5 minutes. But, you might wind up with too few undershirts or too many socks. If you add a suit to mix, it adds another layer of tedium and challenge.

Lucky for you, we have just the trick when it comes to packing your sport coats and suit jackets.

Avoid ruining your valuables with this...

by using our step-by-step instruction:

1.  Grab your suit jacket
2.  Reach both hands into the shoulders of the jacket
3.  Ensure your hands reach to the end of the shoulder inside the jacket
4.  Fold the shoulders back to meet each other (as if clapping your hands together)
5.  Take one of your hands and turn the jacket inside out by folding it over the other shoulder (Keeping the lining outside keeps the fabric safe when packed)
6.  Ensure it's folded over neatly, meeting the other shoulder,
7.  Straighten it out
8.  Fold it half neatly
9.  Place neatly in your suitcase and hop on the bus/car/boat/plane!
