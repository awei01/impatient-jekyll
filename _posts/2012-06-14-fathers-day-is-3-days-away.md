Did you get the dads in your life a gift yet? No time to spare sifting through ties and shirts at the department store? Not sure what latest gadget he'll like most? Too often we get caught up trying to purchase the perfect present, when really simplicity and thoughtfulness are the things people remember.

With a [9tailors gift certificate](http://9tailors.com/gifts), you're giving the important man in your life a customized styling experience. A wonderful idea for a particular and choosy patriarch! And the best part is, you can order it online, straight from home the day of Father's Day, saving yourself the rush and worry of punctuality.

Do yourself a favor, do your dad a solid. Remember, it's the thought that counts! Whether it's a first time father or you great-great-great grandfather, every man can appreciate clothes that will fit his individual proportions, especially when they are made to fit his body.

Also keep in mind our packages with [Polished Advising](http://polishedadvising.com/)! Allison Yee, Polished Stylist, will be in the studio [next Sunday](http://9tailors.blogspot.com/2012/06/desperately-seeking-style-sesh.html) giving complimentary 15-minute styling consultations, helping you work through your wardrobe to develop your style. You'll finally be able to approach your closet with an acute eye for detail!
