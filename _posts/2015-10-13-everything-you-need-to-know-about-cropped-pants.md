In the past decade, the way men wear pants hasn’t changed much. Conventionally pants should cover the top of your shoe with a defined crease where your shoe meets your ankle. However, in the past year, the cropped/cuffed pants trend has been making it’s way into mainstream retail. Here are some tips on how to ease yourself into this stylish trend, and pull it off looking great.

### **The Do’s and Don’ts**

*   **DO:** Let your cropped pants fall an inch above your ankle.
*   **DON’T:** Wear anything above ankle socks when your cropped pants aren’t cuffed.
*   **DO:** Wear chunky shoes.The bulk of this look should be in the shoes, not the socks. Because this look exposes your shoes, don’t be afraid to show off!
*   **DON’T:** Wear wide-leg cropped pants. When it comes to this look, width is very important. The narrower the better. You can, however, get away with a strictly straight leg pants.
*   **DO:** Wear ankle boots. They work very well with this trend, and for the colder months approaching.

Note: You should get the length of the trouser to land just on the top of the ankle boot, otherwise the boot pulls the hem and makes it bunch.

### **Pulling It Off**

Casual: This look is mostly meant for casual occasions. The best way to pull this off is with chinos and white sneakers. In [Emmi’s summer to fall transition](http://blog.9tailors.com/2015/10/how-to-transition-from-summer-to-fall-with-guest-blogger-emmi-sorokin/), she highlighted jewel toned chinos as a year round staple. Try rolling them up this fall for a fresh new look.

Once you feel comfortable, you can start getting a few of your pants tailored shorter. Another alternative would be to buy trousers that are already cropped. Zara and Uniqlo are great places to start. See examples below.

Work Appropriate: Although better for casual occasions, cropped dress pants are an easy approach to dressing with flair in the workplace. You only need a few subtle changes to pull of varying levels of boldness, because the silhouette is surprisingly refined. After all, cropped pants are the return of a menswear trend in the 1950’s.

Try pairing your cropped trousers with your dress shoes, some statement socks, and a tie that compliments or matches the color on your socks. Or just pair them with black socks, a nice collared button-down and solid knitwear (cardigan or sweater)! The good thing about this trend, is that you can push it as far as you’re comfortable with. If you’re just not feeling it anymore, roll them down!
