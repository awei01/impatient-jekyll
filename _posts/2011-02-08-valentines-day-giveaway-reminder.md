Nominate that special guy in your life (husband, boyfriend, fiance, brother, etc.) for a chance to win a free custom dress shirt and suit (valued at $600). The winner can also opt to design a tuxedo - just need to pay the difference. Why? Because we think he should look good too!

Please send us a short essay (about 200-500 words) or video (about 2-5 minutes) on why he deserves a free custom outfit. For instance, does he work at a non-profit and may not be able to afford a custom clothing? Did he recently overcome an extraordinary situation? Or, does he simply need a wardrobe upgrade? Go ahead. Tell us!

We’ll select one winner from the bunch.

Steps to Entering:

1.  Fan us on the [9tailors Facebook](http://tinyurl.com/4uxnbj9) page. Leave a brief comment on why he should win. If you already a fan, thanks in advance!
2.  Then, submit a short essay (about 200-500 words) OR video (about 2-5 minutes) on why he deserves a free custom outfit to kathryn@9tailors with the subject heading: “Valentine’s Day Giveaway”. Your e-mail should contain the following:
