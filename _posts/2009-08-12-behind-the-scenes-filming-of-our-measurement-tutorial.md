With how busy we've gotten at 9tailors, it was a definite squeeze trying to get the video for our measurement tutorial shot. But with the huge helping hand of cinematography duo Courtney and Patrick, we were able to get it done.

We started by filming the measurements for men- with Chase (from our fashion show) as our model again. And Lyutsiya (pronounced similar to Lucia) was our lovely lady model. It took several takes to get the angles and lighting done perfectly. But we did finally get the hang of doing what we do- just on film! Also, we ordered some delicious pizza and it was... delicious. Here are some pictures from the shoot.

Chase is really tall and Sam is somewhat small so she had to stand on the bench for her demonstration. [![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/DSCN1446.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_vD5aUw8ycQs/SoLgO7sNvLI/AAAAAAAAADs/q8m2S8JEp9g/s1600-h/DSCN1446.JPG)   
Now we're in the process of editing the film and getting it put together for people to actually use. It will be super useful to teach people how to take accurate body measurements, the way a tailor would do it. I'll post the video here once it's ready, and it'll also be up on our website.

For now we've got a lot on our plate, with the upcoming trunk show at the end of the month. I'll be preparing for the event, and trying to stay cool (and out of the humid heat) for the next few weeks!
