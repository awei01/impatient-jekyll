9tailors is looking for models for two upcoming photo shoots. They are coming up soon, so if you think you can model, apply today! **Email your information to makiko@9tailors.com**.

Here is the information we need:

1) at least 2 photos of yourself- one up close, one full body shot, & the more photos the better  
2) body measurements- chest, waist, and hip  
3) height  
4) weight  
5) suit size  
6) color of eyes, hair, & skin  

We are looking for both male and female models of any ethnicity. Please have a professional look as we will be shooting in uniforms and suits.

The chosen models will receive the photos from our shoot as well as 9tailors merchandise (specifics TBD).

Good luck!
