Custom has many perks. Not only do you get to design the fit and style of your garments but you can also add some touches that make your garment extra special. From monograms to linings we have plenty of options to satisfy your appetite for one-of-a-kind clothing. Below are some linings that really went beyond the standard.

With zebra lining and a red welted edge this really makes a statement. No chance of mixing up your jacket with another when it is this personalized.

It may seem somewhat irrelevant to some, placing patterns and colors inside a jacket, but its all part of creating something that is so uniquely you it boosts your confidence and is the beginning of an inspired day.

Let at 9tailors style consultant know if you have an idea for the lining of your jacket that can't be found off the rack! Send us an email at info@9tailors.com to get some more information.
