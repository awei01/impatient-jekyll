9tailors, Boston’s premier custom e-tailor, is looking for male and female models for upcoming photo shoots. Think clean, young, fresh, romantic; visit [9tailors](http://beta.9tailors.com/) and [Christian Schlubach](http://christianschlubach.com/work/index.shtml) for a sense of our aesthetic. Diversity in size, shape, and color appreciated. Experience preferred. Looking to book in two weeks. First photo shoot will be in February.

Models must be:

*   18 to 35 years old
*   Photogenic
*   Comfortable working with other models
*   Able to do own hair and makeup
*   Able to get to Boston for go-see, fitting, and shoot (No reimbursement for travel)
*   Willing to work for digital images or in-kind services

If you fit the bill, email [celia@9tailors.com](mailto:celia@9tailors.com) with “Model Call” in the subject line. Include your:

*   Comp card (or several headshots and full-length shots)
*   Modeling resume
*   Body specs (height, weight, chest/waist/hip measurements)
*   Clothing specs (shirt size, pant size, shoe size, bra size)
