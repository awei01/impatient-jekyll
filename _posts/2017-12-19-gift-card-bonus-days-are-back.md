Gift card bonus days are back, but for a limited time only. When you purchase a gift card (purchase [here](https://9tailors.punchey.com/giftcards)) between December 19 and December 24, 2017, you'll receive a separate bonus e-gift card for 10% of the gift card value.

Many want to know what's an ideal amount to give since you can give any amount to your loved one. Generally, for a custom shirt, we suggest giving $100.00 to $150.00. For a custom two-piece suit, we suggest a gift card that starts at $600.00.

For our gift card bonus, you'll just need to purchase a gift card that is at least $100.00. We'll send you the 10% bonus gift card (bonus gift card valued up to $100.00) separately in your email.

We'll be off December 23 - December 25 and again, December 30 - January 1. If you have any questions, you can email us at [info@9tailors.com](mailto:info@9tailors.com) or call us at 617.286.6135.

Some more rules and restrictions for our gift card purchase:

*   Gift card purchase can be made online, in person, over the phone or email.
*   Bonus gift card will be delivered separately to the gift giver's email.
*   Gift card value must be a minimum of $100.00.
*   Bonus gift card value is capped at $100.00.
*   Does not apply to past gift card purchases.
*   Valid for gift card purchases made between 12/19/2017 through 12/24/2017 at 11:59 EST.
*   Other sales or promotions do not apply.
*   Cannot be redeemed for cash or cash equivalent.
*   If initial gift card is refunded, the bonus gift card will be voided.
