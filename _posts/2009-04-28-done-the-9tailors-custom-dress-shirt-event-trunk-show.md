This past weekend we had our first (successful!) custom dress shirt event and trunk show. Over 40 people came in to visit us at the [Guilded Boston](http://www.guildedboston.com/) studio on Newbury Street!

Here are some pictures from the event. All photos were taken by the ultra talented [Christian Schlubach.](http://christianschlubach.com/)

The wondrous and amazing thing about Christian's photographs is that he was able to capture our models and products in a seemingly peaceful and tranquil environment. In fact, however, a whirlwind of activity was actually taking place only inches away!
