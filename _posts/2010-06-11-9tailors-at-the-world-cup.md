The FIFA World Cup is coming up, and Taylor Twellman, the New England Revolution soccer player, will be the exclusive analyst for ComCast Sportsnet. Better yet, all of those times you see him on the screen, he will be completely outfitted by 9tailors!

Here is one of the first of his commentaries. You can find them online [here](http://www.csnne.com/pages/v1_landing?blockID=250587), or view below.
