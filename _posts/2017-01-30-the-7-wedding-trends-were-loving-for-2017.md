Planning a 2017 wedding? We've compiled a list of the top wedding trends that will be a big hit this year.

#### Industrial + Modern Spaces

Industrial spaces won't be going out of style anytime soon. We'll be seeing **a lot of exposed brick** this upcoming year. This time around there will be a mix of brick and modern elements such as glamorous chandeliers.

#### Warm Colors

Incorporate warm tones of yellow, red and golden oranges into your wedding decor and wardrobe. Amp up your tuxedo with marsala, also known as maroon, as a base for your jacket and pants and add black satin to your lapel. If you can't pick just one, going with multiple colors is another trend for 2017.

#### Small Intimate Ceremonies

Are you having a destination wedding? Or have you decided to keep the invites to a minimum? You're right on trend for 2017. **Keep it sentimental with a small ceremony.** Small ceremonies allow you to focus on the smaller details. Also, your guests will feel super special to have received an invite.

#### Simple Boutonnieres

Keep it simple and sleek this upcoming year. It's all about simplicity for 2017. The less fuss the better.

#### Engraved Wood Invites

Wooden invites are a great touch for a rustic wedding. They also **add a rustic touch to any wedding**. A small touch that shows you are really into the finer details for your wedding.

#### Live Band

Everyone knows a wedding is basically one huge party... once you get through the serious stuff like the ceremony. Sure DJs are cool but 2017 is the year of the live band.

####  Two Looks for the Groom

Brides can have two looks... so why can't the groom? A classic black or navy tux for the ceremony is a great formal option and a bold pop of color for the reception is a great fun option. **Does he have a favorite color?** Go with that for the second look. There's nothing wrong with showing a bit of personality!
