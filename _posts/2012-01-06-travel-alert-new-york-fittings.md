Diet, deprive yourself of your favorite vices, "enjoy life more!", and do all this while being less stressed.  No wonder most people have [given up on the top ten resolutions](http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2040218_2040220_2040221,00.html) by mid-February.

Here is an easier one, dress better.  We will even provide you with your very own Style Consultant to help you create a look that suits your body type and your lifestyle.

Outside the Boston area? We will even take it one step farther and bring the styling to you! Check out our travel calendar. Take the first step in creating a better dressed version of yourself by making an appointment today.  Email us at [info@9tailors.com](mailto:info@9tailors.com) to request an appointment.
