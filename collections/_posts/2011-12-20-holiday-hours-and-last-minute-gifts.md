With only a few days left until Christmas, we thought that we would let you know what our studio hours will be for the next few weeks.

December 24 to December 26: CLOSED  
December 31 to January 2: CLOSED

Our Style Consultant, Alex, will be here to assist all of you all other days from 11:00AM to 7:00PM.

If you are like the many last minute shoppers who need a gift, but our studio is closed, you may purchase a gift card [here](http://www.9tailors.com/gifts). Need some convincing? [BostInno](http://bostinno.com/2011/12/19/hey-procrastinators-weve-got-you-covered-last-minute-boston-gift-guide-for-him-her-the-kids/) recommends as one of the best gifts to give him for last minute Boston shoppers. And, Lauren Antos, owner and designer from our favorite women's ready-to-wear clothing line, [Lily & Migs](http://www.lilyandmigs.com/home/Lily_%26_Migs___The_Official_Site_and_Online_Store.html), also recommends our black gingham shirts as a great gift on [New Brahmin](http://www.newbrahmin.com/blog/2011/12/19/holiday-madness-jenn-barron-lauren-antos-of-lilymigs.html)!

Happy Holidays!
