Holidays are continually pushed farther and farther back until eventually we will be decorating for Christmas in August. Well, at 9tailors we don't want to extend the holiday season, just make an appearance during the height of the festivities. That is why we want to give our clients a break on their holiday tuxedos and wrap up the season with a final suiting deal.

The first person to make an appointment for a holiday tuxedo will receive **75.00 off their purchase**! Since we can only have one #1 we have decided to give everyone else 25.00 off their holiday tuxedo when ordered before 11/6!

You can't beat the fit of a custom tuxedo. This is one of the most attractive qualities of designing your own clothes, although, with that comes the need to cultivate a bit of patience. The work of art you will be hanging on your body cannot be created over night. Because of this we recommend planning ahead and ordering those holiday tuxedos now so they will be ready and waiting to start the party.

Check out our client and model, Bryan, in his midnight blue tuxedo.

With expert advice from a style consultant you will be the best dressed man at your Christmas party. Make an appointment today by emailing [info@9tailors.com](http://www.blogger.com/info@9tailors.com) and get started!
