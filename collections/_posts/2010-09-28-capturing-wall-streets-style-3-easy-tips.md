The movie, _Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps_, just opened in the theater. How polished do the characters look in the movie! I know it's easy to fall into the business casual trap (Dockers and a button-down shirt). But, why not elevate your look for this fall with three easy tips? The looks are effortless...I promise.

Choose a slim silhouette that is tailored through the body.[![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/shia-labeouf04.jpg)](http://www.gq.com/images/style/2010/03/shia-labeouf/shia-labeouf04.jpg)  
3\. Finally, complete your look with a vest. Jacket optional.

In a recent WSJ.com article, costume designer, Ellen Mirojnick mentioned that Shia LaBoeuf's character, Jake Moore, wears six custom suits (some featured above) - each worth about $6,500. However, to get the above looks (without breaking the bank), visit us in our Boston studio. Contact 9tailors at info@9tailors.com or at 877.513.1898.
