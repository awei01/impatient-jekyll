Doesn't this just make you want to wear a suit? This image is from [The Sartorialist](http://thesartorialist.blogspot.com/), a daily read for many fashion enthusiasts, photographers, and anyone who enjoys some good eye candy.

BIG NEWS- **Did you know that 9tailors is launching a suiting line in September?** If you're already a 9tailors client, you are eligible to be a "suit tester" during our current preliminary phase. You receive a custom made suit for 50% off the retail price in exchange for some feedback regarding fit and service.
