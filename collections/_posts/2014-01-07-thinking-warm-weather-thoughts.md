We were so thrilled when we received these photos from the talented ladies at [Studio Nouveau](http://www.thestudionouveau.com/). With the blustery nor'easter and frigid temps, it was very sweet of them to take us back to summer through their images of David and Julie.

Several months ago, we had the pleasure of working with David and Julie on their Cape wedding. What a fantastic couple to work with! They were so excited for their low-key, casual affair. And, we couldn't be happier that they wanted to work with us.

Having broad shoulders and athletic build, David was most concerned about the cut. In his words, he wanted a "better fit" for his suit. He was looking for a suit that was tailored, yet comfortable enough for him to move around in at the wedding.

David was also interested in finding the right material. Because their wedding took place on the beach in August, heat was a factor. We chose a beautiful, light-weight wool that breathed well. David also wanted the suits to reflect his fun personality. As David says, custom "allowed me to put a personal touch on the suit." While David monogrammed his suit with his wedding date, the two groomsmen personalized each of their suit jackets with the phrases, "I need it for hockey" and "You all right?".

David's best advice? "Don't cut corners and buy lower quality clothes."

We couldn't agree more.
