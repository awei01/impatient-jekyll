There are only 11 days left for Christmas shopping. That also means there are only 11 days to decide what you’re going to wear at those large holiday gatherings. In any case, you want to look nothing short of stylish, put-together, and Christmas-y!

I have put together a few articles of clothing that will look great with a dress shirt.
