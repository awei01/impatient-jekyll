Michael Bastian has just won the [CFDA](http://www.cfda.com/)'s award for best menswear [designer of the year](http://www.nbcnewyork.com/blogs/threadny/THREAD-CFDA-Award-Nominee-Michael-Bastian-Takes-Control--Finds-Inspiration-in-a-Dressed-Up-Generation-123016613.html)! He is also the only designer to have his namesake collection nominated for the award every year since it's creation in 2006. His designs hit home with American classics sporting strategic pops of bright colors and alternative patterns. We have chosen a few ensembles from the Michael Bastian Spring/Summer Collection 2011 to inspire our readers:

There are infinite combinations when choosing how to wear your 9tailors 3-piece suit! Here, Bastian has paired his vest and jacket with a pair of jeans. While the [bow tie](http://www.collaredgreens.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=COLLARED&Product_Code=BT-1112-05&Category_Code=MEN) and pocket square reflect the steely color of the suit and the blues in his plaid shirt, the wonderfully [bright belt](http://www.bonobos.com/store/item/leone_braconi_red_suede_contrast_stitch_belt) and [red-rimmed sunglasses](http://www.ray-ban.com/usa/sunglasses/rb4140/768-51) give this dapper man a much more interesting look without going overboard.

The shawl collar and wool window-pane check are great design options that are rarely used in our Bostonian fashion. Come design your new shawl-collar blazer at 9tailors! Add to this look with [vintage styled glasses](http://shop.shwoodshop.com/PhotoGallery.asp?ProductCode=OWD_WLN) and a [woven belt](http://www.bonobos.com/store/item/navy_woven_belt_chocolate_leather).

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Bastian1.jpg)This is a fantastic casual look! Don't let the bright yellow skinny jeans

scare you away, try [this color instead](http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=534858&CategoryID=11221&LinkType=#fn=COLOR%3DBrown%26sp%3D1%26spc%3D7) and pair it with the ever-classic [suede bomber jacket](http://www.saksfifthavenue.com/main/ProductDetail.jsp?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524446385774&FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=282574492703599&bmUID=iTt6c5w&ev19=2:24). Accenting this look with a light-weight 9tailors cotton dress shirt and a [knit tie](http://www.ralphlauren.com/product/index.jsp?productId=11085264&view=all&ab=viewall&parentPage=family) will take this look from [Tom Cruise circa 1986](http://www.imdb.com/media/rm3448027648/tt0092099) to the modern streets of Boston.
