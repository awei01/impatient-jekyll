Packing can be stressful, aggravating, and tedious. But, add a few new tricks to your repertoire and it should be smooth sailing from here on out.

Don't mess around with an extra garment bag for your suits. This video will help you stick with one-bag packing and streamline your travel by demonstrating how to **fold a suit properly**. In other words, it prevents wrinkles.

Another tactic to save time is **keeping a packed bag**. Rather than waking up at 4am to pack for that business trip, make a habit of repacking your bag after every voyage with a fresh batch of essentials.

[**Roll your shirts**](http://www.wikihow.com/Roll-Clothes) instead of folding them saves room in your bag and also prevents crumpled clothes.

Consider buying [**poly-cotton blends**](http://9tailors.blogspot.com/www.9tailors.com) which are more wrinkle resistant than 100% cotton shirts.

If you are a frequent flier consider purchasing a [pass to cut the lines at security screening](http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/21/business/la-fi-0321-travel-briefcase-20110321). For around $180 annually and some background checks you can save hundreds of hours a year by avoiding those treacherous queues.
