Having been featured in a fall wedding inspiration shoot (along with the talented teams at [HelloLove Photography](http://www.hellolovephoto.com/), [mStarr Event Design](http://www.mstarreventdesign.com/), [Ceremony Boston](http://www.ceremony-boston.com/) and a few others), we wanted to share volume IV of [mywedding -The Magazine](http://www.mywedding.com/). It is available online as well as a printable version that you can get [here](http://magazine.mywedding.com/).

 Our super 150's charcoal grey custom suit was featured as the groom's attire.
