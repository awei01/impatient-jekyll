Hey now, gentlemen, we have some exciting news! We have launched [Sterling Kane](http://www.sterlingkane.com/) in the 9tailors studio! You may now purchase made-to-order luxe leather accessories right here with us! Feel free to swing by and cop a feel of the top-of-the-line, genuine hides they offer. So lovely to the touch. Accoutrements include wallets, credit card cases, belts, watch straps, duffel bags, and even iPhone cases. The impeccable quality at such affordable pricing cannot be beat. The exceptional caliber of 100% American alligator skins has an amazing smooth feel and beautiful scale detail. Sterling Kane also uses non-exotic leathers like American bison, a top-tier luxurious skin among pebbled varieties.  See [here](http://www.sterlingkane.com/leather-and-craftsmanship/) for more detailed information on their leather quality and craftsmanship.

_Co-founder, Jayme Mendal:_ “This all started when I was shopping for a leather weekender bag and couldn’t find a nice one for under $1,000. I got together with my brother, Abram, who worked in the leather business, and asked him what it would cost to have one made for me with the nicest leather, lining and hardware out there…turned out it was a small fraction of what all the existing brands and retailers were charging. With that, we saw an opportunity to deliver luxury quality leather goods at significantly more affordable prices. So, I conducted a study while at school and we put together a simple new retail model, which allows us to deliver world-class quality stuff at mainstream prices. And we’re excited to share this with the Boston community through our partnership with [9tailors](http://9tailors.com/)!”
