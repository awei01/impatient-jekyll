_You_ do? Go ahead and like us on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/9tailors/49696314250).

We love our clients. That's why we will pick one fan and provide a shirt at every one's favorite price, **FREE**. We will randomly pick from our fans and provide the lucky winner with a $100 store credit. Go wild designing a custom shirt that shows off your personality- and figure.

Check out some of the new fabrics you can choose from! Go bold with a patterned shirt or get creative by mixing and matching patterns as contrast. Check out some past examples [here](http://9tailors.blogspot.com/2011/08/last-week-of-sample-sale.html), and [here](http://9tailors.blogspot.com/2011/07/and-back-by-popular-demand-buy-3-get-1.html), and [here](http://9tailors.blogspot.com/2011/07/contrasting-like-pro-must-run-in-family.html).

Here's one for the stripe lovers.
