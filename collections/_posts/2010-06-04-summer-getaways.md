The summer solstice is upon us- on June 21. And with the new season, where will your packed bags take you? Better yet, with _what_ will you pack your bags?

We're going to do a series of posts on vacation destinations, both near and far, with tons of packing and styling ideas for your trip. Where is your favorite place to spend a relaxing weekend? Where have you always dreamed of going? Let us know and we will make a post on your favorite vacation destination!
