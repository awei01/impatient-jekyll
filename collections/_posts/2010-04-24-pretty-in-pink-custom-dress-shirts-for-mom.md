Mother's Day is just around the corner, on Sunday, May 9!  

So, why not treat your mom to a personalized gift? She picks out the fabric, the collar style, the accents...It's like [build-a-bear](http://www.buildabear.com/) for your shirt. So, even if you and your mom have completely different styles...you'll rest assured knowing that she'll wear her shirt over and over again.

Make a joint appointment for you and for her by calling us at 877-513-1819 or using our online [appointment booker.](http://beta.9tailors.com/pages/customer_service/appointments_and_events)  

When you buy a gift for mom, you will both receive a 15% discount on your purchases.

Or, purchase a gift certificate so that she can come in at any time she pleases! Gift certificates come in any amount. $60 covers the price of our base shirt, and $90 and over will cover the price of some of our premium fabric and design options.

Take a peek below at some samples of fun and feminine fabrics and accent colors just in time for May 9. Give us a call or email us at [info@9tailors.com](mailto:info@9tailors.com) to let us know how we can make your momâ€™s special day memorable!
