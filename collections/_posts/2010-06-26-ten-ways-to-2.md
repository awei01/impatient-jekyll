Over the next few weeks, we will be discussing 10 simple ways to amplify your wardrobe.

Today's topic is the white shirt: how to spice it up and do something different from the ordinary!

A white collared shirt is crisp, classic, and versatile. But how can you wear a white shirt for more than just a typical day at the office?  
See below for the first 5 tips: (5 more to come this week!)

  

1\. With a skinny tie. Whether patterned or solid, a skinny tie can make a white shirt look more modern and fun; great for a casual after-work look.

3\. With a contrasting collar and cuffs. At 9tailors, you can choose any one of our many fabric choices as a contrast: from stripes and paisleys to sharks and sailboats! See a few of our styles below:
