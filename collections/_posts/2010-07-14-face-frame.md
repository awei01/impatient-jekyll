Ever wonder what "spread" or "tie space" meant? Ok, well here is a plain and simple diagram of a collar with explanations- so you'll never wonder again.

**1\. Collar Points** \- The tips of the collar.

**2\. Collar Point Length** \- The distance from the Collar Points to where they meet the Collar Band.

**3\. Collar Band** \- the piece of fabric that wraps around the neck.

**4\. Collar Height** \- The height of a folded collar as it fits on the neck.

**5\. Tie Space** \- The distance between the top of the folded collar parts when the shirt is buttoned.

**6\. Spread** \- The distance between Collar Points.
