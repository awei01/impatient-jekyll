With all the trends coming and going many of us simply ignore them and stick to basics. Whichever stark adjective you use to describe your wardrobe, try something different. Here is a little addition that can reshape your look and isn't major investment- a scarf.

The past few seasons the runways have been full of brightly colored, patterned, and striking scarfs. Try one with your tailored suit to break up the sea of black and blue that is your commute, try one with jeans to proudly proclaim itâ€™s the weekend, or try one with your favorite dress shirt when you are going out at night for some added warmth.

Here are a few of our favorite examples.

Robert Downey Jr.'s patterned scarf is an perfect addition to a tailored suit in a neutral navy.
