Office dress codes seem to be getting more and more relaxed these days. What started as Casual Friday is now casual every day of the week in some leading industries. But what encouraged companies to forgo suits on Fridays in the first place? The answer is this:

**In 1962, the Hawaiian Fashion Guild launched a campaign to push the iconic Aloha shirt (more commonly known as a Hawaiian shirt). They sent two shirts to every member of the Hawaiian Senate and House of Representatives, lobbying the government to encourage all Hawaiian men to buy and wear them in support of the state’s garment industry and economy. They also said the shirts were essential for staying cool and comfortable during the state’s hot summers. Then they went a step further and persuaded the government to allow its employees to wear the shirts to work on Fridays.**

**Casual Fridays caught on in the mainland states around 1990, when employers wanted to improve company morale without spending any money. Ironically, the relaxed dress code created a new source of stress in the workplace: without their suit and tie safety net, Americans had no idea what to wear.**

**Cue Levi’s. Don’t know what to wear to work? We’ll tell you, they said. They created _A Guide to Casual Businesswear_ and sent it to HR offices across the country. The guide helped companies outline their own new dress codes, while advertising Dockers as ideal office wear.**

Khakis and dress shirts became the new uniform in no time. Today with bold blazers, textured ties and lots of layers to play with, the possibilities are endless.
