Festivus at Felt was so much fun--no lines, no cover, fun people, and free pool sponsored by 9tailors! Thanks to everyone who came out, and a special shout-out to all the new friends we met. Hi!

If you missed the event, you also missed Dashing, Dapper, and Debonair--a.k.a. Victor Wang, our marketing intern; Ernie Chin, [NAAAP Boston](http://www.naaapboston.org/) leader; and Phil Han, [Get Prept](http://getprept.com/) CEO and Festivus organizer. They're all wearing 9tailors shirts! Extra kudos to Phil, who is single-handedly bringing bowties back to Boston. Click on the photo to zoom in--it's made of a plaid fabric with skull-and-crossbones details. How wonderfully whimsical!

If you haven't heard of this [Festivus](http://festivusweb.com/) of which we speak, you're missing out! Here's a photo of the folks who brought it to mainstream America...

...and a short clip to bring you up to speed.

  
Happy Festivus, and happy holidays from 9tailors!
