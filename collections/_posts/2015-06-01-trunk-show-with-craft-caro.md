You are a modern gentleman. You own custom dress shirts made with the finest Egyptian cotton. You wear custom suits from one of the most renowned mills in Italy. All you need now is a place for exceptionally designed and well-made men's essentials from leather flasks to mustache comb. Our friends at [Craft & Caro](http://craftandcaro.com), an online purveyor of beautifully-made men's goods and essentials, has everything to help you cultivate an elegant and distinctive lifestyle. Also, if you've been on the hunt for an unforgettable Father's Day gift, your search is over.
