We are so excited to introduce our new custom suits for weddings and parties! What makes our wedding service so unbelievably amazing?

What makes our custom wedding service so unbelievably amazing?

First, our Style Consultants will work with you one-on-one to help you design a custom shirt and suit that will complement your wedding style. For instance, having a fall wedding? We’ve got tons of options to stylishly incorporate fall colors into the groom's outfit. Same goes for spring, summer, winter and every theme between.

Second, our Style Consultants will measure you and your groomsmen from head to toe to ensure that perfect fit. Not in Boston or in New York? No problem! We've created a measurement tutorial to make it easy for your out-of-state groomsmen to get fitted for their custom outfits! Our custom shirts and suits fit. Guaranteed.

Third, our Style Consultants will track your custom wedding party order from start to finish, so you don't have to worry about all the details.

Finally, value. Our custom suits and shirts are affordable, one-of-a-kind pieces that you won’t find at your local department store. A custom two-piece suit is $490.50 and a three-piece suit is $625.50 (both with free shipping). For wedding parties of 3 or more, you’ll receive a 15% discount and free shipping (to one address) on your entire purchase.

Here's what some of our clients have had to say about us:

"Having trouble locating the exact shirts that I wanted for our destination wedding, I contacted Sam and the crew at 9tailors. Their patience, selection, and expertise is unmatched in the city of Boston, not to mention the cost and service is so great, I plan on purchasing all of my shirts from here. 9tailors made our wedding a success with no stress, and without breaking the bank! Thank you 9tailors! - Brian H.

"I had an excellent experience with 9tailors when ordering shirts for my wedding party. Even with many changes and 6 different sized men, they were gracious and prompt with the order. We got many comments on the shirts from the moment we put them on. I cant wait to go to Boston to visit the shop." Jeremy N.
