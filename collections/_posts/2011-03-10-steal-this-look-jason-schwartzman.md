Have a classic style with a quirky twist? Slight build? Here is your man. Jason Schwartzman is the poster boy of how to dress for your stature. Standing at 5'6" he towers above his counterparts.

Perfectly fitted suits and button downs, not unlike the ones available at 9tailors, pocket squares, cardigans, and flowing locks separate him from the rest. Below are some prime examples of his creativity.

Buffalo Checked](http://9tailors.blogspot.com/2011/02/fall-wedding-in-buffalo-check.html) shirt under a textured sport coat, sky blue button down with jeans, varsity jacket under a suit? Yes, please.

Schwartzman style in a nutshell- Steps to creating your new look.

1\. A perfectly tailored button down which creates long lines giving the illusion of height. He isn't afraid of bold patterns and doesn't shy away from color.

2\. A funky accessory to make a classic your own. Check out the varsity jacket with a classic two piece suit above. It can easily be swapped for a cardigan as a substitute for the traditional three piece suit.

3\. Unexpected shoes. Beware as this look as it may not be appropriate for more conservative occasions. But, casual shoes with formal wear is unexpected and makes for a playful look. The opposite is great as well, casual wear with formal lace-up's.

4\. For evening wear opt for a tux with a peaked collar which accentuates the shoulders.

5\. Attitude. Bring your confidence when sporting an original look. If you decide it looks great, people will follow your lead.
