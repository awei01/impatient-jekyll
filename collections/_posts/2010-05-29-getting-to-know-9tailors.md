So who exactly is running the show, here? Once in a while, we're going to do some interviews of 9tailors staff and post them right here, on our blog. That way, we can all get to know each other a little bit better. Let us know who you are, too! Where are you from? Where do you like to shop? What do you want to see more of on the blog?

There will be an interview posted tomorrow. Can you guess who it will be?
