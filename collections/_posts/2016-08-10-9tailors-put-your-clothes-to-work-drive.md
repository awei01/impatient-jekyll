With this years [sample sale](http://blog.9tailors.com/2016/08/its-time-to-shop-our-biggest-sale-of-the-season/) underway we hope you are just as excited as we are. The best part about it all is that you can add new items to your closet while making a difference in the life of someone else. We have partnered with [The Goodwill](http://www.goodwillmass.org/) to provide gently worn men's and women's clothing to those who are entering the workforce. We all know how important it is to make a great first impression and what better way to do so than with clothing that makes you feel great.

Last year Goodwill collected more than 23,000 pounds of clothing, which benefited over 500 people through the Clothing Collaborative for Job Trainees, a quarterly event where individuals put together a complete interview-appropriate outfit from the donated clothing. To learn more about Goodwill and their programs visit [www.goodwillmass.org](http://www.goodwillmass.org/) and follow them on social media @GoodwillBoston.

When you make a donation to the Put Your Clothes to Work Drive you will also receive 10% off any item of your choice over $100. Purchase that blazer you've been eyeing or stock up on a few dress shirts for the fall. The choice is yours!
