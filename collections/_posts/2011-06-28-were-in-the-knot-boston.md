We're very excited as we just learned that one of our lovely couples has been featured in this month's [The Knot](http://www.theknot.com/) magazine!

This month's issue available on newstands now.

The "Real Weddings" spread. Check out the groom's shirt and vest on the lower right!

The lovely bride, Liana, is founder and executive director at [New Brahmin](http://www.newbrahmin.com/), a style and fashion blog. Her husband, Michael is the owner of one of Cambridge's newest and hippest restaurants, [Area Four](http://www.areafour.com/).

Liana and Michael were married on a farm in Western Massachusetts. It was one part part [Ralph Lauren](http://www.ralphlauren.com/home/index.jsp?direct), one part cowboy and one part bad-ass. We made classic vests in a beautiful, textural gray herringbone and white oxford dress shirts. Both vest and shirts were accented in a velvety, brushed buffalo check in red and black.
