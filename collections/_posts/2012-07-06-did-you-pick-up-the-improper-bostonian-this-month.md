If  you didn't then you should! They have graciously chosen [9tailors](http://9tailors.com/) as Boston's Best Tuxedo! We are humbled and overjoyed to accept such a title. We wouldn't have achieved something like this without such loyal clientele! We love working with you, so thank you for your continued support!

Not to mention, our talented and wonderful photographer, [Mr. Channing Johnson](http://www.channingjohnson.com/), was chosen as Best Wedding Photographer. Congratulations, Channing!
