[![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/nowinski_shirt.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_RlJ3L7W6dBw/SvGZC7WeTDI/AAAAAAAAH4I/_lIQw_4pms0/s1600-h/nowinski_shirt.jpg)Yep. That's one of our shirts on CSPAN.  
Shirt worn by former [WWE](http://www.wwe.com/) wrestler and  
founder of the [Sports Legacy Institute](http://sportslegacy.org/), [Chris Nowinski](http://www.chrisnowinski.com/).

We received an e-mail from one of our clients, Chris Nowinski, yesterday. He shared the above photo with us. It's him in his 9tailors shirt on CSPAN. If I do say so myself, he looks quite dapper in his cutaway collar and french cuff shirt. If you guys are wondering, that's fabric [A1.](http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/saHijUmIPPFTFZuf_XdkDA?feat=directlink)

Why does the name Chris Nowinski sound so familiar? Well, he's former WWE wrestler, "the Scholar," and founder of the [Sports Legacy Institute](http://sportslegacy.org/). SLI focuses its research on the degenerative brain disease Chroni Traumatic Encephalopathy, or CTE, a condition caused by repetitive concussive and sub-concussive brain injuries. The Institute serves professional athletes, such as football players, and military veterans. To learn more about his cause, go to sportslegacy.org.

It's nice to hear that our clients are doing good and looking good.
