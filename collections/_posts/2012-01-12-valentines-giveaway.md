Write it, rap it, sing it, scream it - then send it.  It could very well result in a free [9tailors](http://9tailors.com/) outfit.  What better way to show your special someone you care than entering them in a giveaway this Valentine's Day.  And, for everyone still flying solo, we won't leave you out just because you're single.  Submit yourself, we respect the independent men and women of the world.

Create video (no more than 1 minute, please) or write a few lines (no more than 50 words, please) on why you or your's should win the free outfit and send it to me at [kathryn@9tailors.com](mailto:kathryn@9tailors.com).  I will then submit you to public scrutiny through our [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/9tailors/49696314250?ref=ts) page.  There you will be tried by your peers and only one will be successful.  Don't forget to include a photo!

Bribe, threaten, coax, plead, and demand that everyone you know votes for your story.  The story with the most 'likes' will win the honor of designing a custom outfit with their very own style consultant at the [9tailors](http://9tailors.com/) studio.
