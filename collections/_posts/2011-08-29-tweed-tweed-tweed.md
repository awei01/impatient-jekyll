Well gentlemen, here you have it. Tweeds in every shade and weave. Request after request, we now have what you all seem to be craving. With fall lurking just around the corner here are some chunkier fabrics to usher in that cozy feeling that autumn brings.

Here are a few options that were just introduced to our ever growing collection of suiting fabrics. And, of course, we will have suede options available for elbow patches.

Done in a warmer brown with hints of red this is a unique option for a full suit or blazer.

For a cooler option, try the one above with grey undertones as opposed to the warmer option below.

This options has brown undertones and a chunkier weave without the geometric patterns of a herringbone.

The swatch above has a herringbone pattern with warm brown tones. Great for separates or a full suit if you are feeling extra bold.
