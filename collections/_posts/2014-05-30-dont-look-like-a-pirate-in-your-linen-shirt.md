Linen may conjure up some pretty bad images, like billowy pirate shirts or those ads about vacationing in the Caribbean. Don't fret. Our _new_ linen has been updated. Here are a few tips to stay dry and look cool:

1) Go fitted. Like your favorite pair of jeans, the more you wear your linen shirt, the looser it will feel. So, stick to a slim fit and buy a custom one through [9tailors](http://9tailors.com/).

3) Try a color other than white. There is something refreshing about a brightly colored linen shirt. It's unexpected. Color makes it more fun and less island-casual. This season try faded salmon, indigo, or burnt orange. Our linen options start at $180.00.

3) Linen is not just for bumming around on the beach. While it's ultra-casual feel suggests beachwear, you can sport this look with brightly colored khakis or jeans. Whether you are on the go or in the city, you can pull off a polished look with linen. A plus? You don't have to worry about ironing. Wrinkles are inevitable. It's part of the charm of donning linen.

4) Don't sport your linen shirt with a pair of matching linen pants! Case and point...
