Hello everyone!

We're going to try something new this week. The idea is that we will have you, our readers, submit photos to us of either your favorite item of clothing or an item of clothing you like but don't know what to do with. It can be anything from a funky tie to a favorite summery linen shirt.

After selecting one reader photo, we will create design boards incorporating the item. Then, at the end of the week, we will welcome viewer comments on which design board you like best and the person who submitted the chosen photo will also choose their favorite. Maybe we will even get some photos of people using a design board inspiration in real life!

Here is an example of what a design board might look like:
