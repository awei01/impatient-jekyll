Pick up the current issue (Jul. 27- Aug. 9) of Stuff Magazine at your favorite bar or cafe to check out this year's HOT 100. Flip to page 56, and see that Stuff has declared 9tailors "Hot How We Like It," under the title Custom Fashion Sites.

Indeed, I think that affordable, customizable fashion is pretty hot. What do you think?

You can view Stuff Magazine's website [here](http://stuffboston.com/), but this particular article isn't online yet. Gotta get it in print!
