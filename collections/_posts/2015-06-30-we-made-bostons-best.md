Be sure to pick up a copy of this month’s Improper Bostonian as 9tailors was named Best Tuxedos in their annual “Boston’s Best” edition. 9tailors is no stranger to this accolade with our first win in the same category in 2012. Our “unique fabrics and custom styles” and “concierge level of service” helped to earn us this year’s win.

We also want to congratulate all other winners on the list. Some of our favorites are Shojo, an Asian-fusion restaurant named Best Food & Drink in Chinatown, Danger Booth, a photobooth and photography company named Best Photo Booth, and Ceremony, a must-shop wedding dress destination in Beacon Hill that won Best Gowns.
