When the holidays come around there are droves of red clothing items that hit the rack in stores everywhere. Red is one of those colors that can be a bit overwhelming if you are unsure of how to wear it.We’ve compiled a list of our favorite ways to incorporate red into your wardrobe.

#### Red Sweater

A super easy go to especially during this time of year. Fair isle sweaters are everywhere! Everyone loves a good fair isle sweater. Who doesn't love snowflakes and polka dots? Great for the weekend paired with jeans or casual Friday at the office with chinos.

If you want to keep it subtle we'd suggest a maroon sweater and tie. The great thing about this time of year are the tones of red that emerge. You don't always have to reach for the brightest red item you can find. Maroon and gray is a color combination that will always work for the winter.

#### Red Blazer

Attending a holiday party? What better way to make a statement than with a red blazer. Wear it with a white dress shirt for a classic look. If you're looking to make more of a statement a black dress shirt or turtleneck, black pants and black shoes is going to look great on you.

#### Red Coat

A duffle coat is one of the many [fall trends](http://blog.9tailors.com/2016/09/4-fall-trends-you-need-in-your-wardrobe-right-now/) we could not live without this season. Take a break from your everyday neutral and opt for a brighter red. If there is any time when a red coat is appropriate it's now.

##### A Hint Of Red

If red isn't one of your favorite colors we'd recommend introducing it into your wardrobe in small doses.

Red and black plaid is a classic pattern that will never go out of style and scarves are a necessity during the cold winter months.

Socks and shoelaces are two fun ways to incorporate red into your holiday wardrobe. Since these additions are subtle don't feel bad if you're still rocking them all the way until Valentine's Day.
