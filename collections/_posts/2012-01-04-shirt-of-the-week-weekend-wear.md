It's understandable that you may want to get out of your suit after a grueling week of work.  But there is no need to abandon all sense of style when transitioning into your weekend wardrobe.

Pair this shirt with a dark jean and you have successfully created a laid-back look that doesn't make you look like a high school student.

If you need to take it up a notch throw on a blazer in dark grey and you have a polished look that doesn't feel stiff.
