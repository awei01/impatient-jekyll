Over the past several months, 9tailors and the [Liberty Hotel](http://www.blogger.com/libertyhotel.com), one of the most luxurious and fashion forward hotels in Boston, have been working closely on a uniform project. Yes. A uniform project. They were looking for pretty, sexy and professional. This is what we designed together....

We had a quick photo shoot today with some of the girls. Here is a behind the scenes look at today's shoot.
