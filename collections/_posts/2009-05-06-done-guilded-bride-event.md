A few weeks ago, the team and I attended the Guilded Bride event, a high-end bridal show sponsored by [Polished Wardrobe Advising](http://polishedadvising.com/) and [Guilded Boston](http://www.guildedboston.com/). The event was abuzz with activity. Live music was provided by Be Wedding Entertainment. Cakes made by [Cakes to Remember](http://www.cakestoremember.biz/). Wedding dresses sewn by [SEAMS](http://www.seamstheshop.com/) and bridesmaids dresses by [Lily & Migs](http://www.lilyandmigs.com/Lily_%26_Migs_Clothing_Habit.html). And, of course, 9tailors provided all the dress shirts and ties. The beautiful suits were made by our partner, [Evolution of Style](http://c11software.com/eos/).

Here are some photos taken by the most talented photography duo, David and Jo, of [Allegro Photography.](http://www.allegrophotography.com/)
