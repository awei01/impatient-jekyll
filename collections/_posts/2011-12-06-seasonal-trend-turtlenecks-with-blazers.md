The idea of wearing turtlenecks under blazers might remind you of Ron Burgundy holding a glass of scotch. The key to pulling this look off (without looking like a 70's news anchor) is finding the right textures and colors to match your blazer.

[For a more casual look, solid colored turtlenecks with a nice textured pattern (e.g. cable-knit sweaters) pair well with a fitted blazer.](http://lookbook.nu/look/2588163)

For a sleeker look, a cashmere turtleneck will go nicely with a buttoned double-breasted suit jacket, as styled below by Mattias Karlsson. Photo by Daniel Jackson.

The only problem you'll run into is finding a flattering turtleneck. The fabric you choose, the way it conforms to your body, and the way it frames your face should be considered when dressing in a turtleneck.

If you've already found your favorite turtleneck, dig it out of your closet and bring it to 9tailors!
