When your work attire is more on the conservative side, navies, greys and whites can start to get boring. Here are a few tips on how to incorporate some color into a dull outfit:

[![shirts-patterns]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/shirts-patterns2.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/shirts-patterns2.jpg)

While your standard shirts may be white or solid blues, branch out to a patterned shirt with some color in it. Don't want to go too bold? Try a micro-pattern. It will have texture while giving the appearance of a solid shirt.

What better place to have a little pop than your shoes? Get a fun colored pair of laces, or invest in a pair of shoes with a colored sole.

[![RED]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/RED.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/RED.jpg)

Red is a great color to keep it somewhat conservative while still adding color. Socks, suspenders, silk knit cuff links, red works.

[![BOWTIES]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/BOWTIES1.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/BOWTIES1.jpg)

A good way to be subtle is to have a small accessory as your pop of color. A tie, bow tie, pocket square...you get the idea.

There's nothing quite as fun a customizing your suits and jackets! There are endless options to incorporate a tiny bit of color here, a big contrast there, etc.
