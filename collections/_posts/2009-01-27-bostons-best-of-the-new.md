This past weekend the _Boston Globe_ published its top picks for new shops in Boston... and 9tailors was one of them! Read more [here.](http://www.boston.com/thingstodo/gallery/newshopping09?pg=38)

Anyway, on to equally important news... We have introduced a new line of 100% cotton fabrics to our collection! Solids, stripes, checks in a myriad of colors (my favorites are the soft pastel hues). I realize the thermometerÂ reads 16 degrees right now, but it's never too early for pre-Spring shopping!
