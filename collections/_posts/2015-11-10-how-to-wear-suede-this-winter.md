If [color combos](http://blog.9tailors.com/2015/10/the-4-best-go-to-color-combinations-for-fall/) weren’t enough, here’s another way of spicing up your winter wardrobe: suede. Suede garments and accessories are all over the place recently, especially in womenswear. You can, however, find some really great suede accessories for men, most of which are staples in every fashionable man’s wardrobe. From shoes, to jacket and sweater accents, we’ve highlighted a few of the ways you can get in on this trend, while still remaining as rugged and handsome as ever.

Suede shoes are definitely a staple every man should own. They are perfect as boots, loafers, or just oxfords. Black and grey are simple colors that you can find almost anywhere, however, if you wanted to be a little more adventurous you could opt for some bolder colors. Rusty orange, deep blue, or olive green are some great options. Check out GQ’s selections below.

A suede jacket is a great way to wear this trend as well. It gives you the same cool and rugged look as a leather jacket, but with more texture and personality. Suede jackets come in all styles and are very versatile when it comes to layering. Whether you’re out with friends, or stepping out of the office for some coffee, a suede jacket can transform your look from plain to edgy and effortless. Below are some styles of suede jackets and casual shoe options to go with them.

Last but not least, accessorize your regular jackets and sweaters with suede elbow or shoulder patches. It will add instant charm and coziness to your outfit no matter what occasion.
