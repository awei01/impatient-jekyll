Today, 9tailors and Polished Wardrobe Advising will be holding a workshop on the MIT campus. I am so thrilled about the opportunity, not just because I will get to disseminate my knowledge of fashion to undergraduate and graduate school students, but because I will get to re-live (even if it is just for 2 hours) my college experience...\*sigh\*.

Here are the details of the event.

We have a few MIT student models who will be modeling various looks.

I will definitely take photos of the event. So, stay tuned!
