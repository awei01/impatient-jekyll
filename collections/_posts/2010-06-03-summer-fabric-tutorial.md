It's starting to get seriously hot and muggy around here. What are the best fabrics for this climate?

Generally, naturally-derived fabrics such as cotton, silk, and linen are the most breathable in hot weather. Man-made fabrics such as polyester do not breathe as easily, causing you to feel wet and sticky all day.

For men, linen and cotton are both great options. Both fabrics are easy-care, and dry quickly. Lightweight, 100% cotton shirts such as the one below will keep you looking cool and crisp.

A great option for women is a silk-cotton blend. It is easy to care for (doesn't require the gentle care of many 100% silk items), and is very lightweight, flowy, and comfortable. Not to mention that it is a very pretty fabric! Cotton-silk blend blouses like the one below will be pretty and perfect for the summer. And we have a whole rainbow of colors to choose from!
