Do you find that you are always reaching for a navy, black or solid pocket square? You might want to think twice before doing so. Now is a great time to add a little color to your look. A fundamental addition to any outfit, the pocket square is now considered a modern day essential. For spring/summer swap out your darker hues for brighter colors. It may seem a bit daunting but don't be afraid to experiment with print and patterns. The pocket square is a subtle accent so you are able to make a bit more of a statement without it seeming overwhelming.

Much like a lightweight scarf, a pocket square can be the perfect finishing touch to any outfit. Wearing all blue or grey? Choose a floral or patterned pocket square in a contrasting color to break it up. This is especially easy in the spring and summer when patterns are on trend. Paisley, polka dots and monochromatic animal prints are always a great option.

As far as material goes satin pocket squares are classic, timeless and great for year round. However, if you would like a more matte finish opt for a cotton or linen pocket square. Both are more seasonably appropriate option for this time of year and also provide a bit of texture.
