There is no doubt in our mind that you have given some thought to what you should wear on your first date. You might not have been thinking about it all week leading up to the big day, but we know it has crossed your mind. You've already gotten past the first hurdle of asking her out so you can breathe easy for a few more hours. Now it is time to look in your closet and put together a great outfit that sends a message that you are on your A-game. Remember, you want to appear put together but not as if you tried too hard. Even if it did take more effort than usual, nobody has to know.

We've compiled a few outfits that will help you land date #2. Although what you wear is top priority, don't forget that grooming for the big night is also important. So guys, make sure your hair is trimmed to perfection and that you don't overdo it on your favorite cologne. She's already impressed by you. There's no need to go overboard.

Going Out for Drinks

Make sure you put a little effort into this one guys. This isn't guys night at the sports bar. Chinos paired with a neutral colored dress shirt is what we would suggest. A pale blue or lavender work well and will not seem too overpowering. A navy overcoat and leather boots will bring just the right level of sophistication to you look.

*9tailors Tip: Do your research guys. Don't just take her to any corner bar. You'll want to make sure she has a good time and that you can talk and get to know her. No one wants to be screaming answers across the table to questions they barely heard.

####   
A Sporting Event

You'll want to keep it casual. However, we do not mean you should wear anything ill fitting or something that looks like it should have been thrown away months ago. You still want to impress your date don't you? Opt for a printed shirt, jeans and a chunky cardigan. Keep the palette neutral so that you won't appear overdressed in anyway.

####   
Art Gallery

This is where it can get a little tricky. You do not want to seem overdressed or better yet completely under dressed for the occasion. The best advice we could give is to choose your outfit based on the atmosphere of the gallery. Small intimate gathering with local artist? A collared shirt layered under a crew neck sweater in a contrasting color works great. Now would be a great time to break out one of fall's hottest trends the bomber jacket. It is casual, so we recommend wearing a pair of leather chelsea boots to dress it up a bit. Attending something a little more upscale? Pair your black jeans with a camel overcoat and taupe sweater. You cannot go wrong with this color combo.

Now that you've groomed your hair, found your outfit, and figured out where to go there is just one more piece of advice we have.  Remain confident! Don't let her see you sweat. Plus, you already look amazing and trust us women pay special attention to what you wear.
