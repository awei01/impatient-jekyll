Versatility is one of the greatest assets when designing a new article of clothing. The best pieces can go from day to night or from formal to casual. One of our clients in Brooklyn designed the shirt below. He used some of the new fabrics we recently added to our growing collection for the accents. Check out his creation!

He used a grey broadcloth for the shirt and a purple plaid for the accent color. The final touch- navy buttons. This is a great day to night shirt. Wear it with a purple tie and a navy suit for the office then chuck the tie and swap the slacks for jeans to create an evening look great for grabbing dinner and drinks.

Don't want to break the bank? The shirt above came to the grand total of 104.00!
