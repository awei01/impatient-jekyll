Well Gentlemen, it's time you are as prepared as your female counterparts. I'm not talking about carrying around your world in a man-purse, but simply being ready for anything: any spill, any stench, any rip, any hang nail.

The myriad of disasters covered by this kit may make one think they will now be lugging around a suitcase sized emergency package. This is not the case. The [Minimergency Kit for Him](http://www.seejanework.com/productcart/pc/Minimergency-Kit-for-Him-104p4466.htm) is for the man on the go. It's sleek design makes it acceptable for even the most lackadaisical in their preparations while the stamped handlebar moustache makes a masculine statement.

The pocket size case holds everything from blistex to nail clippers, to stain removers to a needle and thread. Are you ready to be more prepared?
