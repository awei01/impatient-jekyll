Whatever your plans are for this Easter Sunday - Brunch? Early dinner with your significant other's family? - you'll want to look your best. With the promise of great food and the possibility of an impromptu Easter egg hunt, you'll also need to be comfortable. This Sunday is the perfect time to break out your pastel dress shirts as well as your linen and seersucker suits.

Going straight to brunch after church? A 3-piece suit is a great go to. Remember, layers are key for this time of year. You can wear the vest and pants to brunch for a more casual look.

Now that it is officially spring, take this as a sign that it is time to wear your seersucker suit. Not really appropriate for any time before this time of year, given the weather. Keep your color palette in mind when wearing seersucker. The gentleman pictured below keeps his look monochromatic with neutral hues of brown and tan. This will help keep your look classic and sleek and less nautical.

Not a huge fan of tan seersucker? A light grey is another great versatile option. Pair it with a slightly darker blue dress shirt and navy tie for a bit more contrast. Take this as an opportunity to add a little bit of color with fun socks. Or if you would like to bare it all you can opt for a no sock look with a pair of double monk strap shoes.
