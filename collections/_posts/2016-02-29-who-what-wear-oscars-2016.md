The Oscars are traditionally a showcase of classic, elegant styles, meaning there was no shortage of great tuxedos. Award show style authority Giuliana Rancic even noted that red carpet gents are looking sharper each year, thanks to great tailoring and modern cuts. (What have we been telling you? Fit is _everything_.) Here are a few of our favorite looks:

**Chris Rock**

The evening's host really set himself apart in this white Burberry jacket. This modern twist on a classic style was a fresh way to start the ceremony.

**Eddie Redmayne**

Redmayne looked dashing in this velvet jacket with a peaked lapel. The combination of elegant textures made this Alexander McQueen look super luxurious.

**Ryan Gosling**

We have a feeling white bowties are going to be flying off the shelves, thanks to Gosling.

**Jacob Tremblay**

The _Room_ star proved that style suits all ages. Tremblay wore Armani which, when paired with his coiffed hairstyle, made him look dapper beyond his years.

**Leonardo DiCaprio**

Leo nailed classic and timeless. In this look, he doesn’t need to be holding an Oscar to prove he’s a movie star. But, it certainly doesn’t hurt.
