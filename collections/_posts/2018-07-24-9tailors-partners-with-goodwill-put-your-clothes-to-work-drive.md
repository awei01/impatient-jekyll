This July, 9Tailors is participating in Goodwill’s annual [Put Your Clothes to Work](https://www.goodwillmass.org/donations/put-your-clothes-to-work.html) drive, for a third year in a row—and we need your help! Last year, we were able to collect 165 pounds of professional clothing and accessories, which benefited the participants of [Goodwill’s Clothing Collaborative for Job Trainees](https://www.goodwillmass.org/programs/clothing-collaborative-for-job-trainees.html). This program makes business clothing available (free of charge) to hundreds of disadvantaged men and women enrolled in job trainee programs in Boston. This year, we need your help again.

From **July 24th to July 31st**, bring in your gently-used or unworn corporate clothing, and get **10% off your order of $150 or more**. Your donations can include, but are certainly not limited to: dress shirts, slacks, suits, ties, and belts. Everything is appreciated!

9Tailors is beyond happy to be working with such a good-hearted company and cause. When asked about her thoughts on the collaborative, 9Tailors owner Sam says, “I’m thrilled to have Goodwill as our partner. Our extra sample suits and client donations will help someone who is looking to turn his or her life around, and is seeking employment in our community. It’s a win-win for everyone.”

Contributing to a clothing collaborative that helps so many people every year, is one our favorite annual events—and we have all of you to thank for being a tremendous part of our effort to give back. Your donations, and willingness to participate make such an incredible impact on so many lives. Thank you!
