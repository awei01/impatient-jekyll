He'll be talking all about the custom shoe business, how he got his start, all while fitting you in with an amazing pair of shoes. What more could you ask for? The color and design choices are endless when it comes to bespoke footwear. Prices starting at $1800/pair.

_"Our Bespoke line is reserved for those with a greater knowledge and desire for unique products of superior quality - individuals who seek out the “one-of-a-kind”  With Bespoke shoes, a pair of lasts are made to exacting measurements of your feet. Every bend and curve, the unique shape of your foot, is taken into consideration. You have input into the development of a toe shape and heel height to best suit your personal style." _\- Peter Feeney
