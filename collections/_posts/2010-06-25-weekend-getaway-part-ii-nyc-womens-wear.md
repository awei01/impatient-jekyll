Last week, we did a post for men traveling to NYC for the weekend.

Just as we did for the Cape Cod getaway, today we will focus on fun women's styles for a night out in the big city.

This summer, women's fashion is all about feminine details: ruffles, lace, and chic accessories.

At the 9tailors studio, we offer a variety of chic women's shirt designs, including sleeveless tops with ruffles and frills.

Fabric choices range from dark colors to light, in sheer, comfortable cotton, perfect for dancing the night away this summer.

The next time you are planning to go to NYC for the weekend, pick up a 9tailors shirt to complete your summer wardrobe!

See the design board below for inspirational bows, frills, and layered jewelry to create the perfect fabulous look:
