With Thanksgiving coming up just around the corner we all begin thinking about the holidays. For many, holidays mean Christmas parties, charity galas, and New Year's extravaganzas. We don't know about you but here at 9tailors we believe that one should celebrate in style and what can be more stylish than a spiffy new tuxedo?

If you haven't purchased a tuxedo in a while or if you don't own one yet, now is the PERFECT time. Beginning this Monday, November 20th we are offering **10% off your tuxedo order**. Call us at 617-286-6135 or email info@9tailors.com to set up an appointment with one of our fabulous style consultants.

There are just a few rules and regulations:

*   Sale period: November 20, 2017 – December 9, 2017
*   The promotion applies to all fabric levels. A la carte design options are still full price.
*   If you return any of the promotion items, we will subtract your discount from your return credit.
*   Does not apply to past purchases.
*   Cannot be combined with any other sales or discounts.
*   Shipping and handling charges apply to all promoted items.
*   Void where prohibited.
