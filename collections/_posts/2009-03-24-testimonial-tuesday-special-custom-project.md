The following testimonial is from a very special client of mine, Louise. Louise's daughter, Elizabeth, got married mid-last year. She searched high and low for a store to buy a mother-of-the-bride dress, but couldn't find anything that met her budget, style, color preferences or time frame. Then, her son suggested that she contact us.

We were very happy to receive Louise's request. After listening to herÂ needs, we designed a few draft dresses for her. And, she finally chose a beautiful apple green, floor length gown with a beaded trim. She was so happy with her dress and our service that she has currently commissioned us to make another mother-of-the-bride dress to wear at her other daughter's wedding.

Hear what Louise has to say about 9tailors...

> "I was so pleased to discover 9tailors who designed my gown with bolero jacket in a fabric, color and style that was elegant, custom made, needed no alterations and was delivered directly to my home. There was not another gown at the wedding with the personal touch and style that mine had. I believe I was complimented as much for my gown as the bride was for hers!
> 
> My other daughter is getting married this spring and I am thrilled to again discuss design options, receive fabric samples in colors I choose, and work hand in hand with someone who knows me, my expectations and my taste.
> 
> Thank you again 9tailors!
