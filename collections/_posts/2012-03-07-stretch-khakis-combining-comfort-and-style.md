We've ramped up our basics this spring. What better way to celebrate the dawn of a new season by perking up your wardrobe with new khaki blazers and trousers! From electric blue to soft stone hues (see our spring 2012 trend report here), you will never be without a pair of great looking bottoms for work or play. You'll still be able to get them in traditional sand or olive tones. The added bit of stretch means that it will be comfortable to wear all day without losing its shape so, you won't look like this [poor guy](http://www.thosefunnypictures.com/resize.php?file=pictures/7986/animal-funny-pic-Wrinkled-Dog.jpg).

Khaki blazers start at $300.00 and trousers start at $175.00. Get them in the studio. Request an appointment [here](mailto:customerservice@9tailors.com) or call us at 877.513.1898.
