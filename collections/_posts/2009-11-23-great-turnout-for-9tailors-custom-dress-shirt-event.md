We started off last weekend with a huge bang as we celebrated our fourth custom dress shirt event at our new studio. Allison Abrams from [Polished Wardrobe](http://www.polishedadvising.com/) worked as a style consultant with our staff. Together, they helped 26 new customers and designed over 70 unique shirts!

The weather was a bit of a damper, but even for those who came just to get acquainted, so many fresh faces showed up! The hectic rush of Friday steadied into Saturday closing the weekend with happy customers checking off items on their holiday lists. Many snatched the [Holiday Package](http://9tailors.blogspot.com/2009/11/buy-3-get-1-free-ultimate-holiday.html): Buy three shirts from the Luxury or Premium line and receive the third shirt free (of equal value)! That includes a gift card and free shipping—yes, that’s right.

For those who missed it and would like to take a peek at our new studio, visit us Mondays through Wednesdays from 12 to 5 PM and Thursdays through Fridays from 12 to 7 PM. But remember for this holiday season, we have adjusted hours a bit. Check [here](http://9tailors.blogspot.com/2009/11/holiday-studio-hours.html).

Photos coming soon.
