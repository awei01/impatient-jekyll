Exciting news for those of you working Monday through Friday...we will now have Sunday hours! From 11am to 5pm we will be available for all your styling needs. Hoping to make it easier for you to make it in to the studio for your fittings and design appointments. The premiere Sunday will be the the 5th of next month. See you next Sunday!
