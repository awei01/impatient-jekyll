Last week, one of our Style Consultants, Alex, went to the [Beantown Bride](http://beantownbride.com/) Bridal Lounge at the [Commander's Mansion](http://www.commandersmansion.com/) in Watertown to discuss everything from men's suiting trends to groom's wedding attire. We met some really amazing brides and grooms, including a couple who will be having a Halloween themed wedding in October.

Here are some photos from the event, taken by the fabulous [Tyra Bleek](http://www.tyrableek.com/). If you're in need of a wedding photographer, we highly recommend her work.
