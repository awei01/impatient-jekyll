With fashion constantly evolving it can be a bit hard to keep up with all the trends. Â Not to mention the countless trends that you may think would be tough to incorporate into your everyday wardrobe. Trust us when we say finding new trends to try should be fun not an overwhelming process.

Here are a few of our favorites that we're looking forward to this season.

#### Light Wash Denim

80s and 90s nostalgia is in full effect with this one. Light wash denim is making a huge comeback this year. Seen on the streets of Europe for fashion week the powder blue hue was a definite fave among fashion week goers.

#### Camouflage

No longer reserved for hunters in the wilderness camo is making a bit of a comeback for 2017. Don't be afraid to experiment with color. You don't have to stick to the standard monochromatic green camouflage. Try shades of blue or grey for a more modern look.

#### Lightweight Parkas

A parka in the summer? We know what you're thinking. No you won't overheat. This isn't your traditional parka. You'll be looking for a more lightweight option that will help you transition from winter to spring. Weather in Boston can be unpredictable so having a lightweight option is perfect.

Another perk? Dress it down for a casual weekend outing or dress it up and worn over chinos and a dress shirt.

#### Pastels

Move over navy blue and black peach, lavender, and sky blue are going to be front and center this season. If you're thinking a pastel jacket or pants could be a step too far out of your comfort zone opt for accessories. A lavender tie or a light pink pocket square will add just the right amount of color to your look.
