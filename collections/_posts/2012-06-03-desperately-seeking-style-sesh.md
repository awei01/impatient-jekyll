Not even the most handsome celebs like, [Bradley Cooper](http://www.wetpaint.com/network/gallery/dapper-dudes-on-the-red-carpet-hollywoods-leading-men-arrive-in-style/photo/bradley-cooper-walks-the-red-carpet-at-the-2012-golden-globe-awards), walk down the red carpet without the style help from the pros. So, why should you? Get a free, mini-style session with the fashion-savvy duo, Allison Yee and Meeka Corporán, of [Polished Wardrobe Advising](http://polishedadvising.com/).
