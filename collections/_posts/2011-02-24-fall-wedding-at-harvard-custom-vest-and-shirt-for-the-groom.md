We met Aaron last fall after he had done an exhaustive search all over Boston for a vest and shirt for his fall wedding. While he had already purchased a tuxedo from a local men's store, he wanted a fitted vest and a dress shirt that reflected his clean and modern style. A trusted friend (and a client of ours whom got married last July) recommended that he check us out!

Here are some fantastic photos of Aaron and his lovely bride, Britt, taken by Shang Chen of [Shang Chen Photography](http://www.shangchenphoto.com/index.php?splash=1).
