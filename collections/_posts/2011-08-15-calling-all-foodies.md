Well, it's that time of year again. Time to eat our way through the hundreds of fabulous restaurants around the city for [Restaurant Week- summer style.](http://www.bostonusa.com/visit/restaurantweek/)

Go ahead and double your fun by coupling your 9tailors fitting with a delicious steak from [Ruth's Chris](http://www.ruthschris.com/Steak-House/4999/Boston) or some of the best curly fries in the city, not to mention some of the most interesting cocktails, from [Scholars Boston Bistro](http://www.scholarsbostonbistro.com/), both right across the street from the studio in Downtown Crossing.
