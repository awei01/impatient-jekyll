As many of you may know, 9tailors is running beta tests for both our men's and women's suit lines. This means that you are eligible to receive **a custom-fit, custom-designed suit for 50% off** in return for some feedback from you regarding the experience and the final product via some short surveys.

We have over 250 suiting fabrics to choose from, and are working on getting a larger collections of linings, buttons, and other design options.

**Tell your friends!** **If you are a current 9tailors customer and you refer a friend who purchases a beta test suit (who is not a current 9tailors customer), you and your friend will both be eligible to receive a $50 credit towards your next full priced suit purchases.
