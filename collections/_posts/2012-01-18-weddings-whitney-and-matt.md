Congratulations to Matt and Whitney!  These two tied the knot this winter in a ceremony completely their own.   From the pocket square to the bouquet - this wedding was the perfect fit for a young couple that is anything but ordinary.  Check out Matt's tuxedo details below.  Feel free to glean some inspiration for your pending wedding- after all, imitation is the most sincere form of flattery.

You may recognize the groom, he is our very own [9tailors model](http://9tailors.blogspot.com/2011/11/meet-matt-theres-algorithm-for-that.html) who made his debut this fall.  An active client of [9tailors](http://www.9tailors.com/)' for many years now, Matt continually designs pieces that are one of a kind in terms of fit and style.

For the most important piece of clothing he may ever wear he came to 9tailors with some creative ideas.  He opted for a velvet trim on his tux which sets it apart from the rest with a luxurious and edgy feel.  In order to let the details shine the tux was kept classic in the overall design and topped off with a bow tie and a violet pocket square.

Personalized down to every detail, the couple enjoyed their big day but admits they are relieved that the stress of planning is behind them. As Whitney and Matt know, wedding planning can be stressful and time consuming. Let us help you organize your (unruly?) wedding party and ensuring each member has their outfit for the big day, so you don't have to!  Email us at [info@9tailors.com](mailto:info@9tailors.com) to set up an appointment with a style consultant who can walk you through the process- from proposal to 'I do.'
