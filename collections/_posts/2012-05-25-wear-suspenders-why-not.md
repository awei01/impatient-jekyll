Suspenders, or Braces as they're known to our friends across the pond, were designed to keep trousers around your waist. They've been around for over [300 years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspenders) and haven't gone away yet!

First hard and fast rule: Do not wear suspenders and a belt, it's either one or the other, never the twain shall meet! Suspenders are both functional and fashionable and are best paired with a bow tie, but generally any tie will do. Check out this very informative [article](http://www.atailoredsuit.com/suspenders-how-to-wear-braces.html) how to wear suspenders and [another](http://ebower.hubpages.com/hub/Suspenders) one discussing the history in fashion.

Just the other day, we had a groom in the studio designing a tuxedo. He had asked what we thought about suspenders. Now, we all think this is purely relative to how you want to look. Our advice? If you want to don suspenders with a tuxedo, go for white braces rather than a pattern or black. As we always say, less is more. And tuxedos are the most formal suit of all! White suspenders will blend seamlessly with with a stark white tuxedo shirt, and look extremely sharp. James Bond can do it, so can you!
