You deserve the finer things in life. Good food, drink and clothes. We  want you to give you access to the best in suiting and shirting. We also want you to look your best in the new year. That's why as we wind down 2017,  we want to send you an extra something special to thank you for you for all your support. When you make a purchase $100.00 or more, we'll send you a gift card valued at 10% of your order to spend in 2018. For instance, if you purchase a suit for $600.00, you'll get $60.00 e-gift card to spend on your next full-priced purchase in 2018.

Contact us at [info@9tailors.com](mailto:info@9tailors.com) or at 617.286.6135 to meet with a style consultant.

Enjoy and Happy Holidays!

Sincerely,

Sam & the 9Tailors team
