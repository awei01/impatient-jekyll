Here of the next steps you've been waiting for! Check out the images below to see which items in the previous wardrobes have been kept, and which have been stored.

**Step 3:** Now that you know what you have and you've got it all in tip-top shape, it's time to assess what needs to be added to your collection. In order to do this, you'll want to assess the personality of your new workplace. Is it conservative? More relaxed? Creative? When in doubt, look up to see if your workplace has a dress code and read it. Also, recall how people were dressed when you went in for an interview.

**Step 4:** Now that you have a feel for what sorts of clothes you will be needing, make a list of items you own that fit these qualifications. Make another list of items which you would like to add to your wardrobe. Remember, when in doubt about what you should wear to work, it is always better to come slightly overdressed than under-dressed.
