The holiday shopping sprees are starting. Before we all know it we'll be wrapping presents to put under the tree. If you are not sure what to get that special someone in your life we've got you covered. Check out a few of our top picks for the outdoor enthusiast in your life.

1\. A puffy vest is a great place to start. Not to mention they are great for layering. Navy or black are both great color choices since they are sure to match many items that are already hanging in his closet.

2\. Flannel shirts are always a great go-to item for the fall and winter. Neutral colors such as white or grey work best if you are not 100% sure of what color to purchase. If you know your guy loves bolder colors opt for a bold red or a green with brighter stripes in orange or yellow.

3\. Sunglasses are a necessity. A classic black or tortoise shell frame would make a great stocking stuffer.

4\. A scarf is a must have for the constantly changing New England winter weather. A bold plaid pattern is definitely the way to go. Look for one where the lines are thicker in size. This will add a nice contrast to any other pattern he may be wearing.

5\. Every guy should own a great watch. However, not all watches are created equal. Of course he will have a watch for dressier occasions. But what he'll want to see this holiday season is a watch that will put all others to shame. You'll want it to be both tech savvy and durable. He'll be doing a lot we wouldn't want him to worry about if his watch can keep up.

6\. No man should go without a grooming kit. Our friends over at [Brothers Artisan Oil](http://www.brothersartisanoil.com/products/grooming-kit) have a kit that includes a handmade comb, beard pomade and an oil. After growing out all of his facial hair for no shave november he'll need something to keep it looking great.

7\. Your guy will need somewhere to hold all this things. We suggest a backpack with several compartments. He'll be able to keep everything within arms reach and out of his pockets.

8\. Boots are a must have for the winter. Of course your guy will have snow boots to trudge around in the snow, however everyone needs a pair of boots that are not for the snow. You'll want to make sure he keeps them in good shape so we would suggest a shoe polish. No one likes salt stains on their new footwear.
