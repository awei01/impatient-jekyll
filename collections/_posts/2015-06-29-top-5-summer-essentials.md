With the routine of bundling up in a coat to brush mountains of snow off your car finally in the past, it’s time to make sure you have all the basics for your well-deserved summer. These five must-have items will carry you through all the beach trips, Fourth of July barbeques, and outdoor weddings that fill your sunny weather schedule. And if you’re looking for the ultimate summer uniform, wear these five pieces together and watch the compliments roll in.

### **1\. Linen Jacket**

Need a jacket to top off your look but want something light? If so, say hello to linen. Made from the flax plant, linen is the best fabric for staying cool when the weather hits unbearable heights. And while linen comes in your standard black, navy, and grey, it also looks comes in soft pastels and patterns, so don’t be afraid to be adventurous.

### 2\. Linen Shorts

 Linen does not have to be just for your upper half as shorts are another great way to wear the fabric. Just like with jackets, colors can range from traditional to funky and patterns from basic to bold.

### 3\. White T-Shirt

Next time you’re about to reach for your tried and true white button-down, think again. The classic yet comfortable look you are hoping for with that shirt can actually also be attained by wearing your favorite white t-shirt. When it’s as crisp and well-fitting as your button-downs, a comfortable t with a blazer and jeans or chinos looks casual and put together at the same time.

### 4\. Sunglasses and a Hat

If the temperature where you live is pushing into the high double digits or even breaking 100, a pair of sunglasses and a hat is key to beating the heat.  While this duo might seem like a no-brainer, make sure that your shades and chapeau not only keep you cool but make you look cool. Mirrored lenses and round frames are popular this year, while straw fedoras add a classic touch and caps bring some streetwear inspiration to your look.

### 5\. Sneakers

If you were ever looking for a reason to wear sneakers outside of the gym, your prayers have been answered. Sneakers are the definition of comfort and they can be worn with jeans or even a suit. If you choose to go the suit route, make sure your pant hem is perfectly tailored so you can show off your favorite kicks.
