Now is the time to set yourself apart in a seersucker suit. Before you make your purchase we've covered a few basics so that you'll look your very best this summer. Not sure what color to get or how to properly care for your suit? That's where we come in. We'll let you know what to pair with your suit when it comes to shoes and accessories as well as what colors you should choose.

#### What is seersucker?

Seersucker is a cotton fabric with an alternating pattern. The fabric alternates between a smooth stripe and a bumpy stripe. The bumpy more textured stripes are referred to as "puckering". Seersucker comes in pinstripes as well as plaid.

#### Why is seersucker great for summer?

The puckering in the fabric allows for more of the fabric to be held away from the body. This is especially great for summer. You want a fabric that is lightweight and that is able to keep you cool while you're out and about. Another thing to keep in mind would be to have a half lined jacket. If you're naturally someone who overheats this will help keep you cool since only the shoulders of the jacket will be lined.

#### What color should I wear?

If you'd like to keep your seersucker suit more traditional opt for a wider stripe. A thin stripe is more of a modern take on the seersucker suit. Blue and white are traditional seersucker colors. However, if you're planning on getting married we'd suggest steering clear of these colors. Branch out a bit and enjoy the many color combinations seersucker has to offer. Grey and white as well as brown and white both look great with one another.

White shirts are a great go to when it comes to wearing seersucker. Keep your shirt either solid or with very little texture. This will help when pairing your tie and pocket square. Other shirting options would be a light blue, pastel pink and lavender.

#### What kind of shoes should I wear?

You cannot go wrong with a pair of white bucks. Keep your suit cut slim with little to no break over the top of your shoes.

If bucks aren't your thing a brown shoe and matching brown belt will pair nicely with the seersucker. Think lighter cognac and less of a dark brown color. You don't want to go with anything that is too clunky the more lightweight the better.

#### Caring for your seersucker suit.

Yes seersucker is cotton but you do not want to make the mistake of washing it at home. You wouldn't wash your other suits at home would you? We are hoping you answered no. Your suit is dry clean only. Of course you can freshen it up between wears with a little bit of steam but when it comes to getting it cleaned dry cleaning is the way to go.

#### A quick tip

When wearing seersucker remember that your pants should be lined. If they aren't lined make sure your boxers are neutral and not a bright color. You'll want to make a statement with your outfit and see through pants is the wrong one.
