It's time to say goodbye to the Pantone's 2016 colors Rose Quartz and Serenity and welcome their 2017 color of the year: **Greenery**.

Pantone writes:

> _"Greenery is a fresh and zesty yellow-green shade that evokes the first days of spring when natureâ€™s greens revive, restore and renew. Illustrative of flourishing foliage and the lushness of the great outdoors, the fortifying attributes of Greenery signals consumers to take a deep breath, oxygenate and reinvigorate__."_

While Rose Quartz and Serenity evoked a sense of mindfulness and relaxation Greenery symbolizes **new beginnings and energy**.

With St. Patrick's Day just a few weeks away now is a great time to be on the lookout for that pop of green to add to your existing wardrobe. Having a hard time finding that perfect shade of green? No worries! Since the weather will be heating up pretty soon we'd recommend staying away from forest green and going with a brighter springtime shade of green.
