9tailors isn't just for men. We are continually expanding, and offer an array of styles for women as well. Here is a blouse style that we currently make. Cute, isn't it?

Not only do we do women's dress shirts, but also blouses like the one above. We're always looking for more styles to add to the line. What types of blouses do you like? Look below for ideas- ruffles, wraps, tunics... Have any other ideas? Submit them to makiko@9tailors.com, or leave a link in the comments section. Or, start designing right away [here](http://beta.9tailors.com/).
