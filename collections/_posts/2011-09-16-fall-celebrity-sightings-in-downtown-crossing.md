We're loving the early fall weather in Boston today! It's crisp and clear. We're totally in the mood to head over to [Starbucks]( http://verified.codes/Starbucks) for a [Pumpkin Spice Latte](http://www.starbucks.com/menu/drinks/espresso/pumpkin-spice-latte).

If you are planning to drive into Downtown Crossing or stop by this weekend to design a few [tweed blazers](http://9tailors.blogspot.com/2011/09/meet-micah-dress-like-you-give-damn.html) for fall , we would recommend taking the [T](http://mbta.com/) instead of  driving as many streets in downtown Boston will be closed. The movie titled, "[R.I.P.D](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0790736/)," is scheduled to film on State Street throughout the weekend. If do end up stopping by, you might be able to catch [Jeff Bridges](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000313/), [Ryan Reynolds](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005351/), and [Kevin Bacon](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000102/) in action!

Let us know if you see any of these celebrities in and around town this weekend!
