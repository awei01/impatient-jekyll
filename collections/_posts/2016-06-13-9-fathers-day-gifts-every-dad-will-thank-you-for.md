Has your dad told you not to get him anything or that he doesn't know what he wants? If he has, don't listen! Dads everywhere deserve to be celebrated and even though he may not like to admit it he's totally looking forward to a shiny new gadget this Father's Day.

Dads have a reputation of being the hardest member of the family to shop for. They tend to own everything under the sun. Whether your dad travels for work or it's the first time you're purchasing a gift for your husband there's certainly something on the list he'll love.

#### [**Noise Canceling Headphones**](https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/over_ear_headphones/quietcomfort-25-acoustic-noise-cancelling-headphones-apple-devices.html)

No one likes background noise. Dad can put his headphones on and forget about the rest of the world.

#### [**Running Stroller**](https://www.rei.com/product/871171/thule-urban-glide-stroller)

Whether he's going for a quick jog or taking care of errands for the day a running stroller is a great option for athletic dads.

You'll want to look for one that is lightweight and compact. This makes it much easier when he and the little one are maneuvering the streets of Boston.

Once all is said and done and dad has fulfilled all of this fatherly duties give him the opportunity to escape it all and enter a world all his own.
