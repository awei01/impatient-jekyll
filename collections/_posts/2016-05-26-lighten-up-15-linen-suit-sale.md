It's beginning to feel much more like summer and now is a great time to add a few new lightweight pieces into your wardrobe. What better way to do so then with linen and seersucker? If you happen to be getting married this summer linen is a great suit choice. Perfect for a beach destination wedding or a laid back brunch. Wear them as a full suit or switch it up and pair your blazer with a pair of jeans for a more casual look.
