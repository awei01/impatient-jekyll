Pink Orchid weddings was started by two friends, Emilie Chang and Fiona Ip. Emilie, the creative force, will help your honey decide between alabaster and antique white invitations. Fiona, the organizing whiz, will ensure that every activity, from your first kiss to your first dance, is executed on time.
