We got some buzz going on today about our suits. Check out the Urban Daddy Boston mention today.

Our favorite part about the article? Urban Daddy says, "Youâ€™ll choose from over a thousand fine Italian fabrics, thumb through various lapels, jacket styles and lining options, and even select the buttons to finish off your Cary Grant-meets-Tom Brady masterpiece."

[![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/urbandaddy.jpg)](http://www.urbandaddy.com/home/bos)The article is not on the website yet. But, we're hoping that will go up soon.
