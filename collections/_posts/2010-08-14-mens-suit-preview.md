The above images feature a textured light gray, three-button jacket. Check out the cool blue lining!

The men's suit line will officially launch **October 1st**. Stay tuned for more details.

If you are a current 9tailors client interested in a suit, let us know. We are running a special test phase (regular suit prices 50% off!), but only until August 31st!
